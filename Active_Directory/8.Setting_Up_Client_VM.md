## Verify Network & Internet Connectivity

If configured properly, this PC should automatically be connected to the *internal network* that was created on the *server*. The client won't be connected to the domain yet, but should have internet access and be able to communicate to the server.

#### Open the Command Prompt

In the *search* bar in *Windows 10*, type *"cmd"* and click *enter* or select *Command Prompt*.

![image](https://i.imgur.com/lbcb3ys.png)

#### Run Network Commands

In the *Command Prompt*, enter these three commands to verify the *local network connectivity* and *internet connectivity*.
``` 

ipconfig
ping xvrtech.local ### Replace with your domain name or IP address of server

ping google.com ### or any other website on the internet that will probably not be down.
```

If the network is properly configured, you should see the domain as the *DNS suffix*, an *IPv4 address* and *subnet mask* in the range configured in the server, and the server IP address for the *Default Gateway*. To test local connectivity send a *ping* request to the server name or IP address and seeing if a response is received. To test internet connectivity, do the same but to a website on the internet.

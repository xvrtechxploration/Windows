## Create Admin user and Organizational Unit

After the Active Directory installation and reboot is complete, the login page will look slightly different. Instead of just displaying a username at the login page, it will now list the new domain as well. Rather than a local account, you will login to an account on the new domain. *DOMAINNAME\Administrator* will be displayed as opposed to just *Administrator*.

#### Active Directory Users and Computers

To open Active Directory Users and Computers, open the Start Menu and find *Windows Administrative Tools-Active Directory Users and Computers*. Alternatively you could click the *Tools* button in Server Manager and select *Active Directory Users and Computers*.

#### Create an Organizational Unit (OU)

In the Active Directory Users and Computers window, right click on the domain and select *New-Organizational Unit*

![image](https://i.imgur.com/ajTmcJt.png)

Name the OU *\_Admins*. You don't have to use an underscore, but it will help bring the user created OUs to the top of the list so you don't have to search for it among the defaults. You can unselect the *Protect container from accidental deletion* option if you would like for lab purposes.

#### Create Admin Account (method 1)

Right-click on the new OU and click *New-User*.

Input the user name. For the logon name, optionally put an "a-" before the username (first initial,last name) to represent an administrative account. In my case, *a-xdavis*. Click next.

Enter a password. For the sake of the lab, I chose password never expires. Click next.

To verify the admin account creation, start by signing out of the default administrator account. To sign in with the new account, click *Other user* at the bottom left of the login screen.

Enter the login information for the admin user (*a-firstinitiallastname*). Verify that account is signing in to the domain by looking below the login input for *Sign in to: DOMAINNAME*

To quickly verify that a user was added to a group, use the *net user* command. Open the *Command Prompt* by clicking the search icon and typing *cmd-Enter*. Quickly verify which account and domain your are signed into by using the *whoami* command. For more detailed information about a user on the domain enter *net user username*. The user's name, group memberships, password info, etc.can be seen.

Follow the same steps as method 1 for entering the user's info. Once complete and back in the Users and Computers window, click and drag the new user from the default *Users* folder to the *_Admins* folder.
